DegenDapp is a community-first, no-code launchpad protocol designed to provide an alternative path for launching meme tokens â€” one that prioritizes clarity, fairness, and liquidity from the start.

As the popularity of bonding curve-based launchpads continues to rise, we recognize their innovative approach and growing influence in the meme economy. However, we also believe thereâ€™s room for another model â€” one that's simple, transparent, and trustless, especially for communities that want assurance over speculation.

ðŸ’¡ Why DegenDapp?
DegenDapp introduces a fixed-price, liquidity-first launch model that empowers creators and degen investors alike:

âœ… Clear Launch Conditions
Set your softcap and hardcap from the start. Everyone knows the rules before the game begins. No hidden mechanics, no surprises.

ðŸ”’ Predefined Token Price
Forget unpredictable bonding curves. Token price is fixed, visible, and fair â€” giving early supporters the confidence to ape in without anxiety.

ðŸ’¥ Automatic Liquidity or Fair Refunds
If the softcap is met, liquidity is added automatically to the DEX.

If itâ€™s not, 100% of funds are refunded, without needing to trust any team or intermediary.

ðŸ›  Built for Degens, by Degens

a meme coin visionary,

a builder with zero coding skills,
